    <h3>How do I know?</h3>
    <p>As the great minds say, expertise comes by practice. For me, this holds true in my journey towards developing mobile applications.</p>
    <p>It all started with a Hello World activity a couple of years back with the help of online resources. With constant practice, I gained confidence in developing my own applications as a freelancer. Although, it does not give the corporate
      experience, the path I chose helped me gain a lot of self-respect, perseverance and of-course a lot of learning.</p>
    <p>I also have a full-time working experience for a total of 3 years in the field of telecommunications and SAP ABAP which helped in building knowledge to pursue what I am currently doing.</p>

    <h3>Where did it all start?</h3>
    <em>Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today. â€“ Malcolm X</em>
    <p>Primary and secondary education plays a major role in shapping the future of everyone. My childhood was a combination of everything: games, arts, crafts, books, social work, academics, life-skills, travel. Who I am today is a result of all
      these experiences.</p>
    <p>I completed my academics with Computer Science as a major which laid a foundation stone to my life.
      This is the phase where my creative side was also nurtured.</p>
